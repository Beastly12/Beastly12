Hi there! 🙋‍♂️

I'm Dafe, a software engineer based in Winchester, UK.

I'm currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering, but I’ve already earned various certifications in the field, including a Professional Diploma in Software Engineering. My passion lies in AI and Machine Learning, and I’m excited about the limitless possibilities these technologies will bring in the coming years.

Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects and contributed to multiple organizations, with my most recent experience being at a short-let company. My work spans across different domains, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in software development, problem-solving, and innovation.

Looking forward to connecting and building something great! 🚀
